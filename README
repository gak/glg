Game Ladder Groper: An open-source clan ladder

If you do not know PHP, GLG is not for you! Sorry!

The code is currently unusable as is!
It needs to be tweaked to get going.
There are hard-coded values throughout that requires changing to your own needs... Do a search on slowchop and ausource.
You also need to make your own graphics.
There is a file containing the SQL to set up the database table.
The rest is up to you :)
